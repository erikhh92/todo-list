### Things to improve

Thinks to improve:
- Validation
- Websockets to update the TO-DO lists
- Transitions when opening and adding items
- Order items manually
- Pin items to the top
- TO-DO items belonging to user
- Allow to share items with other users
- Integration of a bookmark or better options in the items like: checklists, formatted text, etc..
